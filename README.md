# Pulsetr

Pulsetr is an open-source platform designed to provide transparent, real-time insights into power system conditions, market peaks, and load optimization strategies. By integrating forecasting algorithms, decentralized communication via Nostr, and scalable APIs, Pulsetr empowers large energy consumers, aggregators, and grid participants to enhance operational efficiency and grid resilience. While initially focused on ERCOT, the project is built to expand and adapt to multiple markets and systems worldwide.

## Vision and Objectives

Pulsetr aims to democratize access to grid and market intelligence, reducing dependence on proprietary platforms and promoting innovation. The platform is structured in phased development:

- Phase 1 focuses on building a data ingestion and forecasting system with real-time alerts published to Nostr.
- Phase 2 introduces a full Nostr client, enabling user authentication and personalized insights.
- Phase 3 adds scalable APIs and webhooks to integrate directly with external systems, and introduces advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.

This phased approach ensures continuous delivery of value while allowing the system to scale with the evolving energy landscape.

## Key Features

Pulsetr will:
- Collect and analyze publicly available grid data to forecast system peaks and market events.
- Publish real-time alerts and insights to Nostr relays, enabling decentralized communication and accessibility.
- Support advanced load management strategies for large consumers through actionable data.
- Offer a modular, extensible architecture with a focus on transparency, reliability, and community engagement.

## Roadmap

1. Establish a robust data ingestion pipeline with basic forecasting and Nostr publishing.
2. Develop a secure and scalable Nostr client with user authentication and personalized dashboards.
3. Introduce API access and webhooks for seamless integration with load management and grid control systems.
4. Expand to multiple markets and integrate AI/ML models for predictive analytics and optimization.
